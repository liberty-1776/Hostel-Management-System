# Hostel-Management-System
A simple project based on an Online Hostel Management System that uses PHP Language with MySQL database.

<b>About Project</b>

This project focuses on managing the hostel work and other works related to hostel serving both admin and students.

<b>Admin Panel</b>

The admin panel has multiple features such as registering a student for first time and providing the students with their respective login details. Further he has the ability to book hostel room for particular student if he/she applies for it offline. The admin can also see the log activity of student. Since the admin is responsible for resolvement of all issues faced by students, he can directly see the grievances added and resolve them for each student. Admin can even manage rooms and has a record of the students registered under each course.

<b>Student Panel</b>

The student is also given the ability to book the hostel whereas it would be finally controlled by admin. If he/she finds any discrepancies, it can be further resolved by him in the Student Details page. The student can also add his/her grievances faced while living in hostel.

<b>Notes:</b>

The project is built in PHP using MySQL. 
You need to build your own database(ðŸ˜‰).
This project was built as a course work for Software Engineering.
